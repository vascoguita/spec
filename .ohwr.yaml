    The FMC PCIe Carrier is an FMC carrier that can hold one FMC card and an SFP connector. On the PCIe side it has a
    4-lane interface, while the FMC mezzanine slot uses a low-pin count connector. This board is optimised for cost
    and is usable with most of the FMC cards designed within the OHR project (e.g. ADC cards, Fine Delay). The board
    is [commercially available](https://ohwr.org/project/spec/wikis/home#commercial-producers).
    
    Labview and Linux drivers are available for the
    [FMC DEL 1ns 4cha delay](https://ohwr.org/project/fmc-delay-1ns-8cha/wikis/home) and
    [FMC TDC 1ns 5cha](https://ohwr.org/project/fmc-delay-1ns-8cha/wikis/home) TDC mezzanine cards.
    
    Boards with a very similar architecture are available for the VME bus
    ([SVEC - Simple VME FMC Carrier (SVEC)](https://ohwr.org/project/svec/wikis/home)) and for the PXI Express bus
    ([SPEXI - Simple PXI express FMC Carrier Board (SPEXI)](https://ohwr.org/project/spexi/wikis/home)).
    
    Other FMC projects and the FMC standard are described in [FMC Projects](https://ohwr.org/project/fmc-projects).
