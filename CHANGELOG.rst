Changelog
=========

2.1.5 - 2021-05-18
==================
Fixed
-----
- sw: check if FPGA is programmed before loading FPGA devices
- doc: improve documentation

2.1.4 - 2020-11-23
==================
Fixed
-----
- sw: SPEC driver detects the correct FLASH only on drivers reload

2.1.3 - 2020-11-16
==================
Added
-----
- sw,drv: module parameter to ignore bitstream version check (for development
  or debug)
- sw: the spec-firmware-version tool can dump build-info

Fixed
-----
- hdl: DMA failures fixed with thight timing constraints

2.1.2 - 2020-11-09
==================
Fixed
-----
- sw: automatize version validation

2.1.1 - 2020-11-09
==================
Fixed
-----
- hdl: report the correct version in spec-golden design

2.1.0 - 2020-11-09
==================
Fixed
-----
- hdl: cross-page DMA failure
- sw: DMA pool memory leak
- sw: fix concurrent DMA tasklet

Changed
-------
- tst: keep the DMA interface open while testing to avoid continuos
  memory re-allocation

Added
-----
- sw: tool to firmware version inspection
- sw: FLASH partitions

2.0.2 - 2020-09-29
==================
Fixed
-----
- hdl: L2P DMA issues reported with slower hosts

2.0.1 - 2020-08-20
==================
Fixed
-----
- sw: program 2 or more SPEC FPGAs in parallel. There is a bug in the
  GN412x chip that we fixed in software by serializing any attempt of
  parallel programming

2.0.0 - 2020-07-30
==================
Added
-----
- hdl: new testbench to test the DMA feature (read/write to DDR memory) in the new golden.
- sw: basic Python module to handle DMA and FPGA programming
- sw: user-space DMA interface in debugfs (read/write)
- tst: add integration tests for DMA transfers

Changed
-------
- hdl: Switch to 125MHz (from 62.5MHz before) clock for DMA transfers.
- hdl: Cleanup of top-levels, addition of DMA to the golden.

Fixed
-----
- hdl: DMA misalignment issue due to loss of 32-bit words, caused in turn by inadequate flow control.
- hdl: typo in synthesis constraints.

1.4.15 - 2020-06-03
===================
Added
-----
- hdl: ignore autogenerated files to build metadata (otherwise the repository
  is always marked as dirty)

1.4.14 - 2020-05-28
===================
Added
-----
- hdl: export DDMTD clock output

1.4.13 - 2020-05-12
===================
Fixed
-----
- hdl: report correct version in spec-base metadata


1.4.12 - 2020-05-12
===================
Added
-----
- hdl: metadata source-id automatic assignment

Changed
-------
- sw: do not double remap memory

1.4.11 - 2020-05-04
===================
Added
-----
- sw: added DMA engine channel for application to the list of resources

Changed
-------
- sw: little code improvements

===================
Changed
-------
- bld: assign dependencies path based on REPO_PARENT
- bld: check for missing dependencies

Fixed
-----
- sw: fix kernel crash when programming new bitstream

1.4.9 - 2020-03-10
==================
Added
-----
- sw: support for kernel version more recent than 3.10 (RedHat)

Fixed
-----
- sw: reduce allocation on stack

1.4.8 - 2020-02-12
==================
Fixed
-----
- sw: fix kernel crash when programming new bitstream

1.4.7 - 2020-01-15

- sw: better error reporting on I2C errors

1.4.5 - 2019-12-17
==================
Something happened while synchronizing different branches and version 1.4.4
could be inconsistent on different repositories. This release increment realign
all repositories

1.4.4 - 2019-12-17
==================
Changed
-------
- sw: better integration in coht, rename environment variable to FPGA_MGR

Fixed
